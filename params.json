{"name":"Andy Zeigert","tagline":"A brief résumé and portfolio","body":"# UI/UX design\r\nI work for GeoEngineers, an earth science and technology company out of their Bend, Oregon, office. I am part of a team that develops applications for data management for both internal use and outside clients.\r\n\r\nUntil early 2015 I was a data journalist. I created maps and charts and other visual journalism for both print and web editions. A [a portfolio of my news work](http://newspagedesigner.org/profile/AndyZ) still lives at NewsPageDesigner.org. \r\n\r\n## News design examples\r\n- A [full broadsheet infographic](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/290833/zeigert_site/map1_Page_1.jpg) about the development of Oregon's state and county boundaries.\r\n- A [hand-illustrated infographic](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/290833/zeigert_site/PBabyBones-g1%20081114.pdf) about baby bones that I researched.\r\n- Another [hand-illustrated infographic](http://newspagedesigner.org/photo/delayed-muscle-soreness) about delayed-onset muscle soreness.\r\n- An [interactive dashboard](http://www.bendbulletin.com/business/centraloregonbusinessindex/) for the Central Oregon Business Index.\r\n- An [interactive graphic](https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/OregonBreweries2/OregonBeer?:embed=y&:toolbar=no&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no#2) about beer production in Oregon.\r\n\r\n# Cartography and GIS\r\nI'm a [certified GIS analyst](http://www.cocc.edu/geographic-information-systems/) and a proponent of open-source mapping technologies.\r\n\r\n## Some examples of GIS and web cartography\r\n- An interactive map showing [fire perimeters in Oregon for 2014](http://imagehosting.bendbulletin.com/maps/firemap/). Created using leaflet.\r\n- An interactive map showing [designated Wilderness Areas in Oregon](http://imagehosting.bendbulletin.com/maps/wilderness/). Also created using leaflet.\r\n- A [three-part series](http://www.bendbulletin.com/home/2185650-151/storm-king-fire-fatal-in-four-hours?storyType=fullPageHTML) looking back at the Storm King Mountain tragedy. I created the maps that accompany the story and helped develop the layout, which is a slight break from the standard template for the site.\r\n\r\n# Freelance graphic design\r\nI also do freelance graphic design work. I'm quite fond of making maps and book covers but also have created some logos and websites. I do freelance design and other marketing work with my business partner, Adam Sears, under the name Apostrophe S Design.

I've even made a couple bad ones. You can find some of my articles at [Comic Book Daily](http://www.comicbookdaily.com/author/azeigert).\r\n\r\n# None of the above\r\nWell, it's good that you're here. I can be found on a few social media sites. My twitter handle is [@zeigert](http://twitter.com/zeigert). My instagram handle is also [@zeigert](http://instagram.com/zeigert). I have [an account at The Old Reader](http://theoldreader.com/profile/ajzeigert) and use it almost every day. You might find me on a few other social media sites, such as [tumblr](http://zeigert.tumblr.com) and [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/andyz), but the ones above are the only ones I keep up with regularly. I also volunteer with Big Brothers Big Sisters and CASA.\r\n\r\n# Mini curriculum vitae\r\nAttended **Ball State University** from 2001 to 2005, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism with an emphasis in Journalism Graphics.\r\nAttended **Central Oregon Community** College from 2013 to 2014, earning a certificate in Geographic Information Systems.","google":"UA-55628983-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
